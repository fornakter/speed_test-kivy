### Check Your internet speed

I make an simple free app to check Your internet speed on mobile device or laptop.

I use:<br>
  python 3.10<br>
  kivy 2.1.0<br>
  speedtest 2.1.3<br>
  
### How to use
You just neet do click 'start'.<br>
Of course You need to connect to internet... and just wait for results

I want to make that app for Windows and Android OS.
Then i try to make it on iOS.
